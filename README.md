# YouTube_DataLake_DEProject
# Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to securely handle, streamline, and analyze structured and semi-structured data from YouTube videos, focusing on video categories and trending metrics.

# Project Goals 
A. Data Lake - We will get the data from multiple data sources and hence we will be needing a centralized repository to store them.  
B. Ingestion of Data - Develop a mechanism to collect data from various sources in different formats or same.  
C. ETL - We will be getting the data in raw format, so we will have to transform the data from raw data to clean data.  
D. Scalability - As our size of data increases, we will have to ensure the system can scale as the data volume increases.  
E. Cloud Infrastructure - As our data will be of vast amount, we won't be able to process it on the local machine, so we will be using the AWS 		 
                          cloud infrastructure for this.  
F. Data Reporting - Build a dashboard to answer key questions about the data.
